## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- used code from previous projects to help with this one
- to center absolute position elemens you can use this common pattern (the code here is different than the one from the actual project), it positions it in the middle of the container its relative to and then the translationX and translationY move it back 50% (moving half of its width and height back to center it perfectly).

.image {
  width: 237px;
  height: 180px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%);
}
-

### Continued development

- continue to learn and get comfortable with web development javascript
- solidifying hover, focus, active pseudo class concepts in CSS
